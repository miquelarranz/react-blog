# REACT BLOG

This is a basic project that uses an external carousel library I created too.

## Installation

Run `yarn` or `yarn install` to install all the dependencies. You may need to configure the `yarn`registry in order to download the package from `npm`.

## Usage

There are some commands to run everything needed:

-   `yarn start`: to run the app locally.
-   `yarn build:prod`: to generate the production build.
-   `yarn test`: to run the tests.

## Content

The app has a the following things developed:

-   Responsible layout that changes in tablet and desktop.
-   A really basic UI, not really cool, kind of vintage.
-   The option to lazy load new images when clicking on the carousel arrows. The state is being kept on a redux store.
-   Component and store unit tests.

## Future

Obviously, there are lots of things that may be improved.

-   Routing to show different posts, now all the information displayed there is fake.
-   Improve the UI a lot.
-   Some e2e tests.
